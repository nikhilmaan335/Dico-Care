        <h1>10 Exercises for Diabetes: Walking, Yoga, Swimming, and More</h1>
        <p>If you live with type 2 diabetes, exercising regularly can help you manage your blood sugar levels and
            weight. It may also help you reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke, reduce cardiovascular risk
            factors, and promote overall health and well-being.

            Exercise can also help prevent the development of diabetes in people who have prediabetes. The American
            Diabetes Association (ADA) encourages people to get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic
            activity per week.

            The benefits of exercising are independent of weight loss. However, compliance with an exercise program has
            to be consistent in order to see lasting results.

            If you’re sedentary and considering starting an exercise program, it’s a good idea to consult a doctor first
            to make sure there are no restrictions or special precautions. It’s always a good idea to start gradually
            and build up to your personal goal.

            Not sure where to start? Here are 10 exercises that can help you reach your fitness goals.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>1. <u>Walking</u></h2>
        <p>You don’t need a gym membership or expensive exercise equipment to get moving.

            If you have a supportive pair of shoes and a safe place to walk, you can start today. In fact, you can meet
            your recommended minimum target for aerobic fitness by going for a brisk 30-minute walk five days per week.

            According to a 2021 review, walking can help people with type 2 diabetes lower their blood pressure, HbA1c
            levels, and body mass index.</p>
        <h2>2. <u>Cycling</u></h2>
        <p>Roughly half of people with type 2 diabetesTrusted Source have arthritis. The two conditions have several
            risk factors in common, including obesity.

            Diabetic neuropathy, a condition that occurs when the nerves become damaged, can also cause joint pain in
            people with type 2 diabetes.

            If you have lower joint pain, consider choosing low impact exercise. Cycling, for example, can help you meet
            your fitness goals while minimizing strain on your joints.
        </p>
        <h2>3. <u>Swimming</u></h2>
        <p>Aquatic activities provide another joint-friendly exercise option. For example, swimming, water aerobics,
            aqua jogging, and other aquatic activities can give your heart, lungs, and muscles a workout, while putting
            little stress on your joints.

            A 2017 reviewTrusted Source found that aquatic exercise can help lower blood sugar levels, much like land
            based exercise does.</p>
        <h2>4. <u>Team sports</u></h2>
        <p>If you find it hard to motivate yourself to exercise, it might help to join a recreational sports team. The
            opportunity to socialize with teammates and the commitment you make to them might help you find the
            motivation you need to show up each week.

            Many recreational sports offer a good aerobic workout. Consider trying basketball, soccer, softball, pairs
            tennis, or ultimate frisbee.</p>
        <h2>5. <u>Aerobic dance</u></h2>
        <p>Signing up for an aerobic dance or other fitness class might also help you meet your exercise goals. For
            instance, Zumba is a fitness program that combines dance and aerobic movements for a fast-paced workout.

            A 2015 studyTrusted Source found that women with type 2 diabetes were more motivated to exercise after
            taking part in Zumba classes for 16 weeks. Participants also improved their aerobic fitness and lost weight.
        </p>
        <h2>6. <u>Weightlifting</u></h2>
        <p>Weightlifting and other strengthening activities help build your muscle mass, which can increase the number
            of calories you burn each day. Strength training may also help improve your blood sugar control, according
            to the ADA.

            If you want to incorporate weightlifting into your weekly exercise routine, you can use weight machines,
            free weights, or even heavy household objects, such as canned goods or water bottles.

            To learn how to lift weights safely and effectively, consider joining a weightlifting class or asking a
            professional fitness trainer for guidance.</p>
        <h2>7. <u>Resistance band exercises</u></h2>
        <p>Weights aren’t the only tool you can use to strengthen your muscles. You can also perform a wide variety of
            strengthening activities with resistance bands.

            To learn how to incorporate them into your workouts, speak with a professional trainer, take a resistance
            band class, or watch a resistance band workout video.

            In addition to increasing your strength, exercising with resistance bands may provide modest benefits to
            your blood sugar control, according to a 2018 study.</p>
        <h2>8. <u>Calisthenics</u></h2>
        <p>In calisthenics, you use your own bodyweight to strengthen your muscles. Common calisthenic exercises include
            pushups, pullups, squats, lunges, and abdominal crunches.

            Whether you choose to strengthen your muscles with weights, resistance bands, or your own body weight, try
            to work out every major muscle group in your body.

            To give your body time to recover, experts suggest taking a day off from muscle-strengthening activities
            between each session of strength training.</p>
        <h2>9. <u>Pilates</u></h2>
        <p>Pilates is a popular fitness program that’s designed to improve core strength, coordination, and balance.
            According to a 2020 study of older adult women with type 2 diabetes, it may also help improve blood sugar
            control.

            Consider signing up for a Pilates class at your local gym or Pilates studio. Many instructional videos and
            books are also available.</p>
        <h2>10. <u>Yoga</u></h2>
        <p>According to a 2016 review, yoga can help people with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar, cholesterol
            levels, and weight. It might also help lower your blood pressure, improve the quality of your sleep, and
            boost your mood.

            If you’re interested in trying yoga, sign up for a class at a local studio or gym. A trained professional
            can help you learn how to move from one pose to another, using the proper posture and breathing technique.
        </p>

        <h2><u>Exercise safety</u></h2>
        <p>Always talk with your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen. In general, ensure you’re adequately
            hydrated before, during, and after exercise.

            Be sure to carefully monitor your blood sugar levels as well to keep them within your target range.

        <h2><u>Frequently asked questions</u></h2>
        <p>Which exercise is best for lowering blood sugar?
            In general, regular exercise can reduce blood sugar over time. Exercises, such as light walking, cycling,
            and other low impact movements, can be helpful.

            Which exercises should people with diabetes avoid?
            Exercises to avoid if you have diabetes will depend on any complications you’re experiencing as a result of
            your condition.

            For example, those with high blood pressure should avoid strenuous activity and heavy lifting.

            Can diabetes be cured by exercise?
            A combination of diet and exercise can reverse diabetes in some people.

            A 2020 studyTrusted Source found that 61 percent of participants with early diabetes who underwent a highly
            regimented 1-year intensive lifestyle that included a low calorie diet and regular exercise no longer met
            the criteria for diabetes.</p>

        <h2><u>The takeaway</u></h2>
        <p>Regular physical activity is important, not only for managing type 2 diabetes but also for promoting your
            overall health.

            If you have any other health conditions in addition to type 2 diabetes, talk with your doctor before
            starting a new fitness routine. They can help you learn how to stay safe and minimize your risk of injury,
